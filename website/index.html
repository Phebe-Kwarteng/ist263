            <h1>The Style Thesis </h1>
 
            <p> Welcome to the style thesis, your lookbook for the intellecutally inclined, the cozy-at-heart, 
                and anyone who believes the best fashion is always a little bit vintage & nostalgic.  </p>

            <h1> What's inside: </h1>    

            <p>
                If your perfect Saturday involves a well-worn book, an oversized sweater, and a great soundtrack, you'll feel right at home.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each page features 2-3 carefully curated looks, each inspired 
                by characters from a tv show or movie, complete with styling
                notes and a paring of 1-2 songs to set the mood for your next
                adventure.
