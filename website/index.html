                Welcome to the style guide, your lookbook for the intellectually inclined, the cozy-at-heart,
                and anyone who believes the best fashion is always a little bit vintage & nostalgic.

            <p>
                If your perfect Saturday involves a well-worn book, an oversized sweater, and a great soundtrack,
                you'll feel right at home.

                <p>

                    Each page features 2-3 carefully curated looks, each inspired by characters from a TV show or movie,
                    complete with styling notes and a pairing of 1-2 songs to set the mood for your next adventure. Whether you're channeling the quirky charm of Stars Hollow or the classic vibes of Padua High,
                    we've got you covered with outfits that blend comfort, style, and a touch of nostalgia.
