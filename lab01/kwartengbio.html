<body>


I’m a graphic design major and I am interested in the way design impacts people’s experiences and preferences with apps and websites. 


 <h2>Here are some things I'm proud of!</h2>

-	Python Programming Certificate
-	Adobe Photoshop Certificate
-	Worked on UX/UI Team for Pixels & Print 2025
-	Interned for the Baldwin Fund

My favorite tv show changes, but as of now it is How I Met Your Mother. I am a huge marvel fan, my favorite movie is Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers Infinity war is a close second. I love to rewatch A Series of Unfortunate Events with my sister, it’s based off a book series we both loved in middle school. I am getting into baking, especially since my favorite season (fall) is coming up.  

Fun fact: I have been a pescetarian for about 4 years now!
