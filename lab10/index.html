    My favorite tv show changes, but as of now it is How I Met Your Mother. <strong> I am a huge marvel fan </strong>, my favorite movie is
    Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers Infinity war is a close second. I love to rewatch A Series of Unfortunate Events with my
    sister, it’s based off a book series we both loved in middle school. I am getting into baking, especially since my
    favorite season (fall) is coming up.

    <strong> Fun fact: I have been a pescetarian for about 4 years now! </strong>
